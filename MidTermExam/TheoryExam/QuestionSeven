Q-7:
Answer: 
In mathematics, the lexicographic or lexicographical order (also known as lexical order, dictionary order, alphabetical order or lexicographic(al) product) is a generalization of the way words are alphabetically ordered based on the alphabetical order of their component letters. This generalization consists primarily in defining a total order on the sequences (often called strings in computer science) of elements of a finite totally ordered set, often called an alphabet.
Write a C programming to print numbers from 1 to an given integer(N) in lexicographic order.
Example:
Input: 10
Output:
Print numbers from 1 to 10 in lexicographic order-
1 10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Input: 25
Output:
Print numbers from 1 to 25 in lexicographic order-
1 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 2 20 21 22 23 24 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
